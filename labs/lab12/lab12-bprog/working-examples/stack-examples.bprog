# Stack Operations
# This file demonstrates basic stack operations
# that work reliably in the BPROG REPL.

# Duplicate a value
5 dup
# Result: Stack: [5, 5]

# Swap two values
1 2 swap
# Result: Stack: [2, 1]

# Pop (remove) top value
1 2 3 pop
# Result: Stack: [1, 2]

# Duplicate and multiply
5 dup *
# Result: Stack: [25]
