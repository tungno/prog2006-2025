# Lab 06: Haskell Greetings message

* Deadline (hard): Friday, 4th of April, 10:15
* Score: 5
* Difficulty: medium
* LLMs: **use only** for explanations. Do not use to generate code.
* Co-pilots: **do not use**
* Coding: code it all yourself. **ONLY** use code that you understand.
* Resources:
   * Haskell books
   * GHCi (interactive interpreter)
   * hoogle.haskell.org


# Objectives

* Basics of error handling with `Maybe` and `Either` types.
* You should try **not** use ChatGPT or co-pilot for code generation. 
* If you do, make it generate code that you want to generate. Code that you understand.
* **Do not copy-paste code** from ChatGPT without READING it and understanding it.


# IMPORTANT (seriously)

Generated code is discouraged, and writing the solution by hand is encouraged.
Only use code you **understand**. Do not use operators that you do not understand.

All of the below have to be completed:
* You use the bind operator `(>>=)` and/or applicative operators: `<$>` and `<*>` to nicely compose your validation checks.
* All your code is written without using `do-notation`
* Do not use `mapM` or `mapM_`




# The task: Galactic Greetings

**Breaking News: Galactic Greetings! Earth Receives Signals from Extraterrestrial Neighbors!**

Hey Earthlings! Hold on to your telescopes because we've got some cosmic news. Our blue planet has just received a cosmic "Hello World" from an advanced alien civilization! 🛸👽

To make sense of these mind-boggling transmissions, Earth's brightest minds have set up a cutting-edge research lab. Picture lab coats, blinking lights, and scientists peering into strange-looking screens — yes, just like in the movies!

Our lab experts are decoding daily transmissions of mind-blowing photonic signals. These signals arrive in the form of a sequence of positive integers. But, there's a cosmic catch! Communicating with our alien pals is only possible if the communication meets certain conditions, and there is no cosmic interference! 

**Transmission Decoding Manual:**

1. **Unique Min-Max Club:** To start the interstellar chat, the minimum and maximum numbers in the transmission sequence must be like unicorns — **unique**! If they're not, well, it's like trying to have a phone call with bad reception. No-go!

2. **Even Sum Extravaganza:** The sum of the minimum and maximum numbers must be an even number — a real party animal divisible by 2. If it's odd, it's like trying to dance the tango alone. Awkward!

3. **Counting Cosmic Vibes:** Now, here's the fun part. Count the number of times the minimum plus maximum, divided by 2, appears in the transmission. That magical number is our extraterrestrial message.

**Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept:**

You, the stellar programmer, have been chosen to implement a software system for decoding the messages.
This system should take the alien transmission sequence as input and return the coded message — the cosmic number! 🚀

**For Example:**

For the transmission:
```
5 5 5 8 1 2 3 4 9 8 2 3 4
```
No cosmic interference detected!
- Minimum number: 1 (unique!)
- Maximum number: 9 (also unique!)
- Sum: 10 (even and divisible by 2)
- Min + Max divided by 2: 5 (magic number!)
- Occurrences of 5: 3 (our cosmic message!)
- **The message is 3! 🌌**

But beware, for transmissions like:
```
5 5 5 8 1 2 3 4 9 8 2 3 4 1
```
Oh no! There's cosmic interference because the minimum number isn't unique. Communication hiccup! 📡🤷‍♀️

So, get ready for an interstellar coding adventure, and let's decipher the secrets of the cosmos together! 🌌👾
 

# Instructions

* Make your code modular. Split the functionality into individual functions
that are composed together to form the final result
* Keep all your functions pure, and only use `getContents` in the `main` functions
* Use `doctests` to test your pure functions before you even implement them! It helps with debugging!
* Make sure that ALL your implemented functions have at least few test cases as `doctests`
* Make sure that `stack test` executes all your doctests and they are all OK


## Gitlab and git

The `lab06` project is pre-initiated for the task. Fork the project into your own workspace
and populate the missing parts.  Make sure that the test harness from the `lab06` project
passes correctly. You will find useful test cases already there.

# Final notes

* The lab should be used to practice chaining validation checks in a nice composable fashion.
* Use `Maybe`/`Either`.  The first version with `decodeMessage` uses `Maybe` but we do not know what the error is. With `decodeMessageImproved` we use `Either`, and can communicate what the problem was.
* Read the instructions carefully.
* Use the provided `stack` project.

From now on the labs are more complex, and you should start using `stack`.

# stack

* `stack new <project-name>` to generate the skeleton  // use use stack new lab06 in sthis scenario
* `stack run` to run your project
* `stack test` to run your tests

For integrating `doctests` check and see the last line of `package.yaml` and `test/Spec.hs` how to modify the stack-genarated project template to include doc-tests.
